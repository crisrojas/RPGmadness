 ### Todo:
 
 - Arme al√©atoire
 - Statistiques de fin de partie: joueur gagnant, nombre de tours, liste des personnages des deux √©quipes avec leurs propri√©t√©s (point de vie, etc.).
 - Differents langues
 
 #### Errors to fix:
 
 - ‚úÖ The while looping that checks if name isn't empty doesn't execute if user enters first an already taken name. How to reacreate this problem
    1. Enter an already taken name
    2. Enter an empty name
 
 - If player choose an action that is out of range the app (obviously!) crashes. See move function
